# Plexify

A Spotify-inspired desktop music client for [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), built with Tauri 2 and React 19. Browse your Plex music library, play tracks with a native audio engine, manage playlists, and explore artists and albums — all from a fast, frameless desktop app.

> Frontend layout and design based on [tauri-spotify-clone](https://github.com/agmmnn/tauri-spotify-clone) by [@agmmnn](https://github.com/agmmnn).

## Features

- **Native audio engine** — Rust-based decoder (Symphonia) + CoreAudio output (cpal); supports FLAC, MP3, AAC, Ogg
- **Library browsing** — Home feed, Recently Added, Hubs/recommendations
- **Artist & Album pages** — Popular tracks, discography, singles, related artists
- **Playlists** — Browse, create, and play smart playlists with infinite scroll and virtual scrolling for large libraries
- **Search** — Full-text search across tracks, albums, and artists
- **Liked Tracks** — Quick access to your starred/rated tracks
- **Image caching** — Custom `pleximg://` URI scheme with on-disk cache for instant artwork
- **Settings persistence** — Plex server URL and token saved between sessions
- **Activity indicator** — Background prefetch progress shown in the top bar

## Download & Install

Grab the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/karbowiak/Plexify/releases).

| Platform | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | `.exe` (NSIS installer) | Run the installer and follow the prompts |
| **macOS (Apple Silicon)** | `.dmg` (aarch64) | Drag Plexify into Applications |
| **macOS (Intel)** | `.dmg` (x86_64) | Drag Plexify into Applications |
| **Linux** | `.AppImage` / `.deb` | See below |

### macOS — Security Warning

Plexify is not currently code-signed or notarized with Apple, so macOS Gatekeeper will block it. Run this in Terminal after downloading to remove the quarantine flag:

```bash
# Remove quarantine from the downloaded .dmg
xattr -cr ~/Downloads/Plexify_*.dmg
```

Then open the `.dmg` and drag Plexify into Applications as usual. If macOS still shows a warning when launching the app:

```bash
# Remove quarantine from the installed app
xattr -cr /Applications/Plexify.app
```

Alternatively, you can **right-click** the app in Applications, click **Open**, then click **Open** again in the dialog — macOS remembers your choice after the first time.

### Windows — SmartScreen Warning

Plexify is not currently code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen may show a warning when you run the installer:

1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**

### Linux

No special steps needed. For `.AppImage` files, make them executable first:

```bash
chmod +x Plexify_*.AppImage
./Plexify_*.AppImage
```

For `.deb` packages:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i plexify_*.deb
```

### First Launch

You'll need a running Plex Media Server with a music library. On first launch, open Settings and enter your server URL (e.g. `https://192.168.1.100:32400`) and your [Plex token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karbowiak/Plexify.git
cd Plexify
bun install
```

```bash
bun run tauri dev   # development
bun run tauri build # production bundle
```

## Running Tests

Integration tests hit a live Plex server. Set your server address in `src-tauri/src/plex/` test helpers before running.

```bash
bun run test
# or directly:
cd src-tauri && cargo test
```
